# Doctors Online Services 🩺

This is a simple, clean and fully functional **HTML-based online doctor appointment system** created by **Syed Muaviz ur Rehman**. It’s designed for users to:

- Contact doctors directly via email or phone

## 🌐 Live Preview (optional)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (External file for logic)
- SVG icons and assets

## 🎯 Features

- Responsive layout and clean UI
- Appointment form with JS validation
- Console-based debugging using `console.log()`

- Separate CSS and JS files for maintainability

## 💡 Why I Built It

Because healthcare access should be simple. This website is built from scratch using real developer logic — no frameworks, no copying. Just pure code written to solve a purpose.

## 🧠 Future Improvements
